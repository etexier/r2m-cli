command.summary=Register or unregister custom commands
command.options=[-v] [-u <commandName>] [-i <sourceFile>]
command.description=\n \
  You can write your own Java or Groovy commands to use with the Magnet shell. \n \
  Once you have created the source file with the custom commands, \n \
  register the file with the Magnet shell by specifying the path or URL \n \
  for the file.\n \
  \n \
  You also use the register command to unregister a previously registered \n \
  command by passing the -u option and the command.\n \
  \n \
  Because registered commands are not persisted in the Magnet shell,\n \
  you must reregister commands if you want to use them after restarting\n \
  the Magnet shell.\n \
