command.summary=Create or update a custom command shortcut for command lines
command.options=[<shortcut> <commandline>]
command.description=\n \
  Use the alias command to create custom shortcut commands for\n \
  command lines. This is useful for command lines that you use often. This \n \
  command is similar to the Linux Bash alias command.\n \
  \n \
  The Magnet shell replaces $n or ${n} tokens in the alias definition with \n \
  the nth arguments; otherwise additional arguments are simply appended.\n \
  \n \
  Running the alias command without arguments gives you a list of currently\n \
  defined aliases.\n \
  \n \
  When you invoke the shortcut command, you can add additional arguments\n \
  to the command line.\n \
  \n \
  @|UNDERLINE Arguments|@\n \

  for which you want to create a shortcut/alias.\n \

  @|UNDERLINE Examples|@ \n \
  \n \
  - Create a quickbuild alias which builds the project without compiling the test \n   \
    code:\n \
  \n   \
    alias quickbuild project-build -Dmaven.test.skip=true\n \
   \n \
  - Run the alias quickbuild and add the option -T 2C (2 threads per core)\n \
   \n   \
    quickbuild -T 2C\n \
  \n \
  - Create the alias quickbuild2:\n \
  \n   \
    alias quickbuild2 project-build --resume-from :myproj-$1 -Denforcer.skip=$2\n \
  \n \
  - Run the quickbuild2 alias specified above and add the server true option\n   \
    to partially rebuild the project and skip the enforcer plugin:\n \
  \n   \
    quickbuild2 entities true\n \
